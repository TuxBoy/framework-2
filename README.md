Stratify is a try at writing a middleware-based web framework.

*Work in progress*

A quick intro:

- middleware-oriented HTTP stack
- CLI console with [Silly](https://github.com/mnapoli/silly)
- dependency injection and config with [PHP-DI](http://php-di.org/)
- module system based on the [PHP-DI kernel](https://github.com/PHP-DI/Kernel)
- PHP 7 only

The documentation is not up to date, and the project is highly likely to change, TODO:

- remove magic and architecture
- implement PSR-15
